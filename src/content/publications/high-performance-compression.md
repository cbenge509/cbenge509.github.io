This work addresses the critical challenge of deploying large transformer models in production environments where computational resources are limited.

## Key Contributions

1. **Massive Compression**: 209x reduction in model parameters
2. **Maintained Accuracy**: Competitive performance with full-scale BERT
3. **Practical Deployment**: Enables transformer models in resource-constrained settings

## Impact

This compression approach enables organizations to leverage state-of-the-art NLP capabilities without requiring expensive GPU infrastructure.
