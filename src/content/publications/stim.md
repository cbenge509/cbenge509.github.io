abstract: "We present STIM (Spatio-Temporal Inference Model), a transformer-based approach for predicting uncorrectable memory errors in data center servers. By analyzing spatial and temporal patterns in memory telemetry data, STIM enables proactive replacement of failing memory modules before they cause server crashes, significantly improving data center reliability."

STIM addresses the critical challenge of memory failure prediction in large-scale data center operations.

## Key Contributions

1. **Spatio-Temporal Modeling**: Captures both spatial (memory topology) and temporal (historical patterns) features
2. **Proactive Maintenance**: Enables replacement before critical failures occur
3. **Reliability Improvement**: Reduces unplanned server downtime

## Impact

Memory failures are among the leading causes of server crashes in data centers. STIM's predictive capabilities enable operations teams to proactively address potential failures before they impact services.
