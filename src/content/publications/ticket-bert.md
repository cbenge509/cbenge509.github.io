Ticket-BERT addresses a critical pain point in enterprise IT operations: the efficient classification and routing of incident management tickets.

## Key Contributions

1. **Domain Specialization**: Fine-tuned language model for IT incident management
2. **Automated Classification**: Reduces manual ticket triage workload
3. **Enterprise Scale**: Designed for high-volume production environments

## Business Impact

Implementing Ticket-BERT can significantly reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) by ensuring tickets reach the right teams faster.
