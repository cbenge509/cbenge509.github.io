abstract: "We present BERTVision, a parameter-efficient approach that leverages BERT's hidden-state activations to achieve competitive performance on visual question answering tasks. Our model architectures are trained on BERT's intermediate representations, enabling efficient transfer learning while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-scale transformer models."

BERTVision demonstrates how parameter-efficient architectures can achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks by learning from BERT's hidden-state activations.

## Key Contributions

1. **Parameter Efficiency**: Achieves competitive results with significantly fewer trainable parameters
2. **Transfer Learning**: Novel approach to leveraging pre-trained language model representations
3. **Multimodal Integration**: Effective fusion of visual and textual information
