A method, computer program product, and computing system for collecting data concerning interruptions associated with a plurality of virtual machines, and for collecting hardware information concerning one or more nodes hosting the plurality of virtual machines at a time generally contemporaneous with the interruptions of the plurality of virtual machines. A correlation is generated between interruptions of at least a subset of the plurality of virtual machines and one or more hardware component attributes of the one or more nodes.
