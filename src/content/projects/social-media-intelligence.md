A randomized controlled experiment revealing that not all spelling errors are equal—phonological errors (sound-based misspellings like "definately") reduce perceived intelligence nearly twice as much as simple typos.

## The Question

In an era where social media posts often serve as first impressions—for employers, colleagues, and connections—does grammar actually affect how intelligent we appear? More specifically: do different *types* of errors carry different weight? We designed a rigorous field experiment to find out.

## Experimental Design

We conducted a pre-test/post-test randomized controlled experiment with 265 participants recruited from UC Berkeley's XLab. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

- **Control**: Social media posts with correct spelling
- **Typographical errors**: Posts with "slip of the hand" mistakes (accidental keystrokes)
- **Phonological errors**: Posts with sound-based misspellings suggesting gaps in word knowledge

Participants rated each post's author on a 7-point scale measuring perceived intelligence, writing effectiveness, and communication quality. We employed deception to prevent response bias—participants didn't know the study's true purpose until debriefing.

## Key Findings

The results were striking and statistically significant (p < 0.01):

| Error Type | Impact on Perceived Intelligence |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Typographical errors | −0.56 points on 7-point scale |
| Phonological errors | −1.14 points on 7-point scale |

Phonological errors caused nearly **twice the negative impact** of simple typos. Our analysis suggests the mechanism: typos can be attributed to carelessness, but phonological errors signal a fundamental gap in word knowledge—a more damning inference about cognitive ability.

## Practical Implications

These findings extend beyond academic interest:

- **Job seekers**: Employers increasingly screen social media—phonological errors may unconsciously bias hiring decisions
- **Professionals**: Even informal posts shape perceived competence among colleagues and clients
- **Platform designers**: Spell-check tools could differentiate between error types, prioritizing phonological corrections

The study provides strong evidence that language errors function as powerful cognitive ability signals, even in casual online contexts where "perfect grammar" isn't expected.
