A comprehensive examination of criminal statistics from North Carolina (1987) employing linear regression models to provide evidence-based policy recommendations for reducing crime at county and state levels.

## Collaborators

Worked with Kevin Kory and Joy First on this capstone project for UC Berkeley's Statistics for Data Science course (W203, Fall 2019).

## Methodology

Applied rigorous statistical methods including linear regression, assumption validation, and overfitting prevention. Addressed critical statistical concepts while maintaining clear stakeholder communication.

## Key Achievements

- Near-perfect assignment score
- Instrumental in earning A+ semester grade
- Emphasized practical application of statistical methods to real-world policy problems
