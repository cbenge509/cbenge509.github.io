Developed machine learning solutions to detect up to 15 facial landmarks in grayscale facial images for a Kaggle competition.

## Challenge

The competition required handling a host of data quality issues including missing or incorrect labels, degraded images, and varied facial positioning across 1,783 grayscale images.

## Approach

Collaborated with William Casey King, Ph.D. (Yale University) to develop a generalized stacking approach using convolutional neural networks. The solution addressed real-world challenges in image processing and neural network design.

## Technologies

Built with Python using Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning, OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, and Jupyter, Pandas, and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
