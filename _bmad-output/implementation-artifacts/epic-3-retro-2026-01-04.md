- `AwardCard.astro` - Award/competition display with placement badges (gold/silver/bronze)

### Pages Created

- `/about` - Full About page with Bio, Education, Certifications, Awards sections

### Content Files Created

- 3 education YAML files (Columbia, Berkeley, IWU)
- 9 certification YAML files (Azure, AWS, MCSM, MCM, MCSE, etc.)
- 8 award YAML files (4 competition + 4 professional)

## What Went Well

### 1. Epic 2 Action Items Applied

| Action Item | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Verify link targets exist | No 404 issues in Epic 3 |
| Verify component imports after creation | All components integrated properly |
| Page tests in `test/pages/` | Correct test location used |
| No inline event handlers | Event delegation pattern followed |

### 2. Card Component Patterns Matured

The card patterns established in Epic 2 (ProjectCard) translated smoothly to Epic 3:
- EducationCard, CertificationCard, AwardCard all follow same patterns
- Hover lift, dark mode, focus ring consistency
- SectionHeading component reused effectively

### 3. Significant Test Coverage Growth

- Epic 2 ended with: 441 tests (180 unit, 261 E2E)
- Epic 3 ended with: 604 tests (247 unit, 357 E2E)
- **Increase:** 163 new tests

### 4. Adversarial Code Reviews Working

Both stories had issues caught in review:
- Story 3-1: Placeholder tests, unused imports, incomplete mock data
- Story 3-2: Missing empty state tests (HIGH severity)

Reviews are catching real issues before they ship.

## What Didn't Go Well / Lessons Learned

### 1. BMM Workflow Status File Not Updated (REPEAT ISSUE - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** After completing dev-story and code-review workflows, the team updates `sprint-status.yaml` but frequently forgets to update `bmm-workflow-status.yaml`.

**Impact:**
- When cache is cleared and `/workflow-status` is requested, incorrect information is returned
- Causes unnecessary rework and backtracking
- User (Cris) has to manually remind team after every step

**THIS WAS ACTION ITEM #1 FROM EPIC 2 RETROSPECTIVE AND WAS NOT FOLLOWED.**

**Resolution:** Both status files MUST be updated atomically in the same operation at the end of every workflow. No exceptions.

**Success Criteria:** Cris never has to remind team to update status files.

### 2. Placeholder Tests Marked Complete

**Issue:** Story 3-1 had tests with `expect(true).toBe(true)` - placeholder assertions that test nothing.

**Impact:** Tasks marked "complete" without actual test coverage.

**Resolution:** Verify tests have meaningful assertions before marking task complete.

### 3. Unused Imports

**Issue:** Story 3-1 had unused imports (`AstroContainer`, `beforeEach`) in test files.

**Impact:** Indicates rushed work, code review overhead.

**Resolution:** Remove unused imports before completing stories.

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| # | Action Item | Owner | Success Criteria |
|---|-------------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | **Update BOTH status files atomically after every workflow** (sprint-status.yaml AND bmm-workflow-status.yaml) | All Agents | Cris never has to remind team |
| 2 | **Verify tests have actual assertions before marking task complete** | Dev Agent | No placeholder tests pass review |
| 3 | **Remove unused imports before completing stories** | Dev Agent | No unused imports in review |

### Technical Debt

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Institution logo placeholders (SVG rectangles) | LOW | Replace with actual logos when available |

### Team Agreements

- Both status files updated in same atomic operation - no exceptions
- "Task complete" means tests have meaningful assertions
- Framework first, content later for Epic 4

---

## Epic 2 → Epic 3 Continuity

### Action Items Follow-Through: 3/4 (75%)

| Epic 2 Action Item | Status |
|--------------------|--------|
| Update tracking files automatically | ❌ NOT FOLLOWED - repeat issue |
| Add link validation to story creation | ✅ No 404s in Epic 3 |
| Verify component imports after creation | ✅ All components integrated |

---

## Impact on Epic 4

### No Blockers Identified

Epic 4 (Publications, Patents & Professional Engagement) can proceed. Foundation is solid:

**Ready to Use:**
- Card component patterns (EducationCard → PublicationCard, PatentCard)
- SectionHeading component
- Content collection patterns
- External link pattern with ↗ icon
- Test infrastructure (604 tests, axe-core, reduced motion)

### Epic 4 Direction

- **Framework first, content later** - Build components and pages with placeholder data
- Publication/patent/CV content will be provided later
- Focus on expand/collapse accessibility for publication abstracts

### Technical Considerations for Epic 4

1. **Expandable abstracts** - New interaction pattern, needs `prefers-reduced-motion` support
2. **Patents** - Schema exists (from Story 1-2), need placeholder content files
3. **CV download** - New functionality, straightforward implementation

- **Product Owner:** Cris Benge
- **Agent Model:** Claude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)

## Next Steps

1. **Start Epic 4** - Run `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story` to create Story 4-1
2. **Apply action items** - Especially atomic status file updates
3. **Framework first** - Build publication/patent components with placeholder content
